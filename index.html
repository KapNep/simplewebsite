After this project,We solve the parking problem by 35% and supposed to be solving the parking problem by 55% by the end of 2027. We implemented a new parking system which track parked cars and the available parking spaces through mobile apps. We analyze the different types of risks and mitigate it accordingly.

                        <p> 
Main goal of this project was to analyze the correlation between population growth and the factors affecting the usage of energy. Initially, I planned to do this through two regressions; one on energy usage and other on cost per kilowatt-hour.All the domains used in this project are applicable worldwide. The energy domain is a prevailing topic in the world as the future of energy usage is largely unknown. Constructed a data acquisition ETL pipeline to demonstrate the correlation of population and energy usage.

                        <p> 
Created a new database using MySQL to store the information across the entire company.The system will be able to accurately, in-real time, track information regarding both the equipment and customers and their corresponding data. This system help to maintain and increase the current customer base(can prevent loss of 5-10% of customers over next five years).

                        <p> In this data mining project, I use python to create a classification problem to detect credit fraud by analyzing the previously available data. I have made this credit card fraud detection project using Tableau and using regression.

                        <p> To practice SQL injection vulnerability remediation, I set up a virtual machine(virtual box) by signing up for a free-tier AWS account. I try to fix the vulnerabilities by editing the PHP files on my virtual machine.
